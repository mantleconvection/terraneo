/// @namespace terra::linalg
/// @brief Contains linear algebra utilities and functions for the Terra project.
///
/// This namespace provides vector and matrix operations, including linear combinations,
/// dot products, and vector manipulations. It defines concepts for vector-like types
/// and block 2-vectors, ensuring that types conform to expected interfaces for linear algebra
/// operations. The utilities are designed to work with various vector implementations, allowing
/// for flexibility and extensibility in numerical computations.
///
/// @note For both, vector-vector and operator-vector operations, users should use the free functions provided in
/// vector.hpp and operator.hpp.
