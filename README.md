# TerraNeoX

Mantle convection code based on [Kokkos](https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos) for performance portability. 

> ❗️The code is early in development, so it is not yet ready for production. But feel free to try it out!

## Getting started

For an overview, general documentation, building instructions, etc. please refer to the [documentation](doc/src/documentation/index.md).

> ❗️The documentation is still under construction and not yet hosted on the web. You can build it locally by
